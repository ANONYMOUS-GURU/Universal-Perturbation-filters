I tried to beat the adversaries in Universal Adversarial Perturbation using various different kind of filter.

Mean filter, median filter were used in the above code and one could use other techniques like bit reduction or other filters.

To Run the above code :
1. Download the dataset using the Download Imagenet folder code
2. Next move the ILSVRC folder to the other folder and run the demo_inception4.py
